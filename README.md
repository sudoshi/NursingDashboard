# NursingDashboard
Comprehensive data model to store ADT, ORM, ORV, and other key HL7 for a sophisticated nursing operations dashboard for optimizing patient flow.

High-Level Overview

The dashboard displays key metrics in card format at the top
Shows critical numbers like current staffing levels, bed occupancy, wait times, and patient satisfaction
Uses intuitive icons and color coding for quick visual understanding


Interactive Tabs

Separates staffing analytics and patient throughput into distinct tabs for focused analysis
Users can easily switch between views while maintaining a clean interface


Detailed Analytics

Staffing Analytics tab shows predicted vs actual staffing needs over time
Patient Throughput tab displays admission and discharge patterns
Both use interactive line charts with tooltips for detailed exploration
